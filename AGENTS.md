# AGENTS.md

## Stack

- OS: Linux / Shell: bash
- Web Server: nginx / Database: MariaDB
- Backend: PHP 8.5+ (flat procedural / class-based, no MVC, no router)
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JS ES6+, jQuery only when vanilla JS is insufficient
- CSS: SCSS → Dart Sass → minified / JS: uglify-js → minified
- Tests: Pest PHP v4 on PHPUnit 12
- Version Control: Git + Conventional Commits + signed commits

## Production Environment

- OS: Linux
- Server provisioned via https://github.com/kyaulabs/aarch/blob/master/pkg/nginx.pkg
- Web root: `/nginx/https/<domain>/www` (symlinked from `/nginx/git/<app>/`)
- Logs: `/nginx/logs/<domain>/` (one directory per domain, dots in domain → underscores)
  - PHP: `php.log`
  - nginx access: `access-<app>_<domain>.log`
  - nginx error: `error-<app>_<domain>.log`
  - Rotated: `.N.zstd` suffix (e.g. `php.log.1.zstd`)
- Temp directory: `/tmp`

## No MVC

PHP pages include Aurora, output HTML directly, and interact with the DB via raw SQL or Aurora's SQL handler. No controllers, no templating engine, no router. `backend/` holds PHP logic not web-accessible.

## Project Context

- `CONTEXT.md` (root) — domain glossary, entities, invariants, boundaries, non-goals. Read before domain-coupled work (see `domain-context` skill). Draft or refresh it via `/prime`.
- `adr/` — Architecture Decision Records (Nygard format). Write one for hard-to-reverse or cross-cutting decisions (see `adr` skill).

Projects live in `/nginx/git/<app>`, symlinked into `/nginx/https/<domain>`.

## Hard Boundaries

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - NEVER edit `cdn/css/*.min.css` or `cdn/javascript/*.min.js` — these are generated (edit source in `cdn/sass/` and `cdn/js/`; see `conventions.md` for details)
> - NEVER commit `.env` files — use `.env.example` only
> - Do not access external APIs without explicit permission
> - Do not modify files outside the project directory
> - New dependencies must be explicitly noted
> - When glob/grep returns unexpected empty results, verify with `ls` before concluding a file does not exist

## File Naming

See `.opencode/docs/conventions.md` for file naming conventions.

## Commenting

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Every file starts with an RCS-style header — see `rcs-header` skill
> - Every file ends with a vim modeline — see `rcs-header` skill
> - PHP classes/methods: PHPDoc (PSR-5) with params, return types, exceptions
> - No explanatory comments unless explicitly requested

## Indentation

Covered in `conventions.md`.

## Testing — MANDATORY TDD

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All new code follows Red → Green → Refactor. No exceptions.
> Use the `@tdd` agent for any new feature or bug fix.
> Minimum 80% line coverage. Run: `php -d pcov.enabled=1 vendor/bin/pest --coverage`

Use the `@test-audit` agent to review an existing test suite.
Pre-push gate: `/check` (php-cs-fixer + stylelint + eslint + pest --coverage).

## Engineering Pipeline

The full methodology, end to end. Follow this sequence for changes with a
behavior delta. Purely trivial changes with no behavior delta (typos, docs,
RCS headers, style-only, patch deps, test-only fixes) follow a fast-path —
see the brainstorming skill for the full definition.

```text
brainstorming → prototype (if needed) → writing-plans → executing-plans → @tdd (per task) → verification-before-completion → /check → @code-review
```

1. **Brainstorm** the change (grilling skill) → spec in `docs/specs/`.
2. **Prototype** (if technical viability is uncertain) → throwaway code to answer the question, then delete (prototype skill).
3. **Plan** the implementation (writing-plans skill) → plan in `docs/plans/`.
4. **Execute** the plan (executing-plans skill) → dispatch tasks to `@tdd`, review between tasks.
5. **Implement** each task via `@tdd` (Red → Green → Refactor, vertical slices).
6. **Verify** completion (verification-before-completion skill).
7. **Gate** with `/check` (lint + coverage 80%).
8. **Review** with `@code-review` before push.

For non-trivial or cross-cutting changes, insert `@architect` before step 4.
For bugs, use `@debug` (disciplined 6-phase loop) before `@tdd` on the fix.
For architectural entropy, run `/improve-architecture` on a cadence.

## Linting & Enforcement

Linting is enforced by `.github/hooks/pre-commit` — it blocks commits on failure.  
Commit message format is enforced by `.github/hooks/commit-msg` via commitlint.  
To activate hooks after cloning: `bash .github/scripts/install-hooks.sh`

For linting details and responsive/mobile-first CSS rules, see `scss-mobile-first` skill.

## Git Workflow

- Branches: `main` (production), `develop` (integration)
- Features: `feat/<username>-<hash>-<description>`
- Commits: Conventional Commits format (type[scope]: subject) — see `conventional-commits` skill
- Signed commits required
- Every commit must include `Plan-by:` (sourced from `agent.plan.model` in `opencode.json`), `Acked-by:` (sourced from `agent.build.model` in `opencode.json` — model ID segment after the last `/`), and `Signed-off-by:` (user) footers. Default Signed-off-by: `kyau <git@kyaulabs.com>`.
- No squash merges. Each logical change is its own atomic commit — the git history serves as the development and evaluation log. A pre-push hook warns on single-commit branches that look like squashes.

After implementing any change — whether via @tdd, a direct fix, an issue
tracker resolution, or a fast-path trivial change — produce a commit message
in conventional commits format before committing. Load the
`conventional-commits` skill and produce: type[scope]: subject + Plan-by +
Acked-by + Signed-off-by footers. The commit-msg hook blocks invalid messages,
but the
message should be well-formed before you reach the hook.

### Commit and push permissions

- **`@tdd`** and **`@resolve-merge-conflicts`** are permitted to `git add` and
  `git commit` — commits happen inside disciplined cycles where the commit
  message is presented to the user before execution.
- The **`build`** primary agent prompts (`ask`) before `git add` or
  `git commit` — the user sees the full command including the commit message in
  the approval dialog. Used by `/release`, `/build-assets`, and design-document
  commits from `brainstorming`.
- **`git push`** is denied to **every agent**. Only the human pushes.

## Build Pipeline

SCSS: `sass --style=compressed cdn/sass/source.scss cdn/css/output.min.css`
JS:   `uglifyjs cdn/js/source.js -o cdn/javascript/output.min.js -c -m`
Assets are built manually. No watchers.

## Dependency Lockfiles

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `composer.lock` and `package-lock.json` are committed to the repository.
> This ensures deterministic, auditable dependency trees and allows
> `audit-deps` to scan known vulnerabilities on a fresh clone without
> installing unvetted packages first.

After any dependency change (adding, removing, or updating a package),
regenerate and commit the updated lockfiles:

```bash
composer update   # regenerates composer.lock
npm install       # regenerates package-lock.json
git add composer.lock package-lock.json
```

## Aurora Framework

Submodule at `aurora/`. Entry: `require_once(__DIR__ . "/../aurora/aurora.inc.php")`  
For the standard page template, see the `aurora-page` skill.
