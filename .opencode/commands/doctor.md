description: Toolchain health check. Verifies all required dev-toolchain tools are installed at the expected version floors. Reports a PASS/FAIL/SKIPPED table per tool and ends with a go/no-go summary. Compares against known-good versions from README.md.

Check every tool the coding harness depends on — runtimes, build pipeline, lint/test, and security/review tooling. Report a consolidated status table. Do not install or upgrade anything.

## 1. Runtimes

```bash
php --version 2>/dev/null | head -1 | sed 's/PHP //' || echo "NOT_FOUND"
composer --version 2>/dev/null | head -1 | sed 's/Composer version //' || echo "NOT_FOUND"
npm --version 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_FOUND"
```

Floor: `php` >= 8.5, `composer` >= 2 (any), `npm` >= 9 (any).

## 2. Build pipeline

```bash
sass --version 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_FOUND"
npx uglifyjs --version 2>/dev/null | head -1 || echo "NOT_FOUND"
npx git-cliff --version 2>/dev/null | head -1 || echo "NOT_FOUND"
```

Floor: `sass` >= 1.69 (dart-sass), `uglifyjs` >= 3.17, `git-cliff` >= 2.0.

## 3. Lint and test

```bash
php-cs-fixer --version 2>/dev/null | head -1 | sed 's/PHP CS Fixer //' || echo "NOT_FOUND"
php vendor/bin/pest --version 2>/dev/null | head -1 || echo "NOT_FOUND"
npx eslint --version 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_FOUND"
npx stylelint --version 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_FOUND"
npx commitlint --version 2>/dev/null | head -1 || echo "NOT_FOUND"
```

Floor: `php-cs-fixer` checks any installed version (same as `php-cs-fixer fix --dry-run` gate); `pest` >= 4; `eslint` >= 9; `stylelint` >= 16; `commitlint` >= 19.

## 4. Security and review

```bash
semgrep --version 2>/dev/null | head -1 || echo "NOT_FOUND"
ocr --version 2>/dev/null | head -1 || echo "NOT_FOUND"
gitleaks version 2>/dev/null | head -1 || echo "NOT_FOUND"
```

Floor: `semgrep` >= 1.168, `ocr` >= 1.7, `gitleaks` >= 8.30. These are run by agents that delegate to sub-tools — if missing, the affected `@semgrep`, `@code-review`, and pre-commit secret scans will skip without error, but no SAST/review/secret-scanning coverage is delivered.

## 5. git hooks

```bash
if [ -f .git/hooks/pre-commit ]; then echo "INSTALLED"; else echo "NOT_INSTALLED — run 'bash .github/scripts/install-hooks.sh'"; fi
if [ -f .git/hooks/commit-msg ]; then echo "INSTALLED"; else echo "NOT_INSTALLED — run 'bash .github/scripts/install-hooks.sh'"; fi
```

## Output

Group results by section. For each tool, report:

- **PASS** — installed and meets the version floor.
- **WARN** — installed but below the version floor (list actual vs. expected).
- **FAIL** — `command -v` returned nothing (tool not found).
- **SKIPPED** — tool is optional and not expected on this platform (e.g. `gitleaks` on a
  shared CI runner where secrets scanning is a dedicated job).

End with a single go/no-go summary table:

GO: 12 pass, 1 warn, 2 fail, 1 skipped. Unblocked for writing code.
NO-GO for CI: fail items must be fixed before CI runs (git-cliff needed for
changelog generation).
```

## Rules

- Never install, upgrade, or modify any tool. Report only.
- Warning (version below floor) does not block — report it and move on. The
  tool may still work for basic use; the floor is the known-good version tested
  in this project.
- Fail (tool not found) blocks NO-GO only for runtime and build tools
  (`php`, `composer`, `npm`, `sass`, `uglifyjs`, `git-cliff`). Security/review
  tools (`semgrep`, `ocr`, `gitleaks`) are "soft-fail" — they gate the
  `@semgrep` / `@code-review` / pre-commit agents but do not block writing
  or pushing code without them.
- `pest` floor is 4.0 (Pest v4 on PHPUnit 12 per AGENTS.md). If every changed
  test file still passes the old version, warn but don't block.
- Version parsing: extract the semantic version from whatever `--version`
  / `version` / `-v` prints. Dart Sass prints a bare version string.
  `gitleaks` uses `version` (not `--version`). `semgrep` may print a header
  line — take the first line only. Handle each tool's quirks.
