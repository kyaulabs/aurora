Audit the test suite for this project. Do NOT make any code changes — produce a report only.

Here is the current coverage output:

!`php -d pcov.enabled=1 vendor/bin/pest --coverage 2>&1 | tail -40`

## What to audit

For each test file you find under `tests/`:

1. **Missing behaviors** — Are the happy path, boundary conditions, invalid input, and error paths all covered? List what is missing.
2. **Weak assertions** — Are there tests that assert `true`, assert a method exists, or make no meaningful assertion? Flag them by file and line.
3. **Coverage padding** — Are there tests that exist only to push a percentage higher without verifying real behavior? Flag them.
4. **Duplicate tests** — Are there tests with different descriptions but identical or near-identical logic? Flag them.
5. **Implementation coupling** — Are any tests asserting on private methods, internal state, or implementation details instead of observable behavior? Flag them.
6. **Missing edge cases** — For each tested function/class, list edge cases that are clearly not covered (null inputs, empty collections, zero values, max values, exception paths).

## Output format

Produce a prioritized list:

**Critical** — Tests that give false confidence (always pass regardless of correctness, or test the wrong thing).
**High** — Missing tests for error/exception paths on core functionality.
**Medium** — Missing boundary/edge case coverage.
**Low** — Style issues, duplicate tests, or minor gaps.

For each item include the file name, a one-line description of the problem, and a concrete suggestion for what test should be added or fixed.

End the report with an overall assessment: is this test suite providing real confidence, or is the coverage percentage misleading?
