## WCAG 2.2 AA — the floor

Every public-facing UI must meet WCAG 2.2 Level AA. The quick checks below are
not exhaustive; when in doubt, consult the spec.

## Prefer semantic HTML over ARIA

Use the native element first. ARIA is a patch, not a replacement.

- `<button>` not `<div role="button">`
- `<a href>` not `<span role="link">`
- `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>` for
  landmarks — do not sprinkle `role="navigation"` on a `<div>`.
- Only add `aria-*` when the native semantics are insufficient (tabs,
  accordions, live regions, custom widgets).

Rule of thumb: **if a native element exists, use it.**

## Focus management

- Every interactive element must be reachable and operable by keyboard.
- Never remove focus outlines without providing a visible alternative
  (`:focus-visible` is the modern choice).
- Focus order follows DOM order. Do not fight it with `tabindex` gymnastics.
- Modals and drawers must trap focus while open and restore it on close.
- Skip-to-content link as the first focusable element on each page.

## Touch targets

- Minimum **44 × 44 CSS px** for primary interactive targets on mobile.
- Adjacent targets need a gap (≥ 8px) to avoid mis-taps.

## Motion safety

- Honor `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.
- When reduced motion is requested, disable non-essential animations and
  transitions, including neumorphic shadow transitions. Snap to final state.
- Do not put essential content in motion that can't be paused or skipped.

## Contrast (neumorphism-specific)

Neumorphism relies on soft shadows on a mid-tone surface, which can fail
contrast. The floor:

- **Text on surface:** ≥ **4.5:1** (AA for normal text), ≥ 3:1 for large text.
- **UI component boundaries** (button edges, input borders): ≥ **3:1** against
  adjacent colors.
- If a neumorphic surface cannot meet the text contrast floor, add a
  visible border or darken the text — do not weaken the shadow.

When the `frontend-design` skill's token values produce a failing contrast
ratio, the accessibility floor wins. Adjust the token, not the component.

## Color & state

- Never rely on color alone to convey state (errors, success, disabled).
  Pair color with text or an icon.
- Form errors: announce with `aria-live="polite"` and associate via
  `aria-describedby` pointing at the error message.
- Disabled controls: use `disabled`/`aria-disabled` and a non-color cue.

## Images & media

- Decorative images: `alt=""` (empty). Do not omit the attribute.
- Informative images: describe the meaning, not the pixels.
- `loading="lazy"` on below-the-fold images; do not lazy-load the LCP image.
- Provide captions/transcripts for audio/video.

## Cross-refs

- `scss-mobile-first` — breakpoints, units, touch target sizes.
- `frontend-design` — neumorphic surface tokens and shadow recipes (contrast
  floor enforced here).
- `frontend-architecture` — JS module pattern for keyboard handlers.
