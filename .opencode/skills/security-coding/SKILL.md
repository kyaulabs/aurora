description: Use when writing or reviewing PHP that handles user input, sessions, auth, cookies, or SQL in this no-framework stack. Covers parameterized SQL, CSRF tokens, XSS output escaping, password hashing, session hardening, and input validation. Detection lives in the @semgrep agent; this skill is the defensive-coding guidance that prevents the findings.
---

This project has **no framework** — there is no ORM, no CSRF middleware, no
templating engine, no router. Every defensive control below must be applied by
hand. The `@semgrep` agent detects failures; this skill prevents them.

## SQL — parameterized, always

Never interpolate user data into a query string. Use Aurora's SQL handler or
PDO with bound parameters.

```php
// GOOD
$db->execute("SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = ?", [$email]);

// BAD — SQL injection
$db->query("SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = '" . $email . "'");
```

- Whitelist column/table names if they must be dynamic — never bind them from
  user input.
- `LIKE` wildcards (`%`, `_`) in user input must be escaped with
  `addcslashes($s, '%_')` before binding.

## XSS — escape on output

Escape for the **context** you're emitting into. Escaping happens at output
time, not input time.

- HTML body / attribute: `htmlspecialchars($s, ENT_QUOTES | ENT_HTML5, 'UTF-8')`
- JavaScript string: encode with `json_encode($s)` (never hand-roll)
- URL: `rawurlencode($s)`
- CSS: avoid putting user data in CSS; if unavoidable, hex-escape.

Never use `echo $userData` unescaped. If you must render trusted HTML, route
it through an explicit allowlist sanitizer and note the exception.

## CSRF — tokens on every state-changing request

- Every POST/PUT/DELETE form includes a CSRF token rendered as a hidden input.
- Token is session-scoped, generated with `random_bytes()`, and validated on
  the server before any state change.
- On mismatch, reject with 419 and do not reveal whether the session exists.
- Same-origin via `SameSite` cookies is a complement, not a replacement.

```php
$token = bin2hex(random_bytes(32));
$_SESSION['csrf'] = $token;
// in the form: <input type="hidden" name="csrf" value="<?= htmlspecialchars($token) ?>">
```

## Passwords — hash, never store plaintext

- Hash with `password_hash($pw, PASSWORD_DEFAULT)` (bcrypt/argon2id).
- Verify with `password_verify($pw, $hash)`.
- Never roll your own crypto. Never MD5/SHA1 a password.
- Reset tokens: `random_bytes(32)`, single-use, short TTL, invalidated on
  login.

## Session hardening

- `session.cookie_httponly = 1`, `session.cookie_samesite = "Lax"` (or
  `"Strict"` where feasible), `session.cookie_secure = 1` on HTTPS.
- Regenerate the session ID on privilege change (login, role escalation).
- Set a reasonable idle timeout; garbage-collect expired sessions.
- Never put secrets in the session; store only an identifier.

## Input validation — deny by default

- Validate on the server, every time. Client-side validation is UX only.
- Use a positive allowlist (validate the expected shape), not a denylist.
- Fail closed: on invalid input, reject and log — do not sanitize-and-proceed.
- Bounds-check integers, length-check strings, allowlist enums.

```php
$id = filter_input(INPUT_GET, 'id', FILTER_VALIDATE_INT);
if ($id === false || $id < 1) {
    http_response_code(400);
    exit;
}
```

## File & command safety

- Never pass user input to `include`/`require`/`eval`/`exec`/`shell_exec`/
  `system`/`passthru` or backticks.
- File uploads: validate MIME and extension against an allowlist, generate a
  random stored filename, store outside the webroot, never execute uploaded
  content.
- `unserialize()` on untrusted data is forbidden — use `json_decode`.

## Headers

Send security headers on every response (via Aurora or nginx):

- `Content-Security-Policy` — restricts script/style/image sources.
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` (or CSP `frame-ancestors`)
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Strict-Transport-Security` on HTTPS

## Secrets

- Never hardcode credentials. Load from environment or a non-web-root config.
- `.env` is gitignored — use `.env.example` only (see `AGENTS.md`).
- Never log secrets, tokens, or password hashes.

## Cross-refs

- `@semgrep` agent — detects violations of the above.
- `audit-deps` skill — scans Composer/npm for known CVEs.
- `database` skill — schema and SQL style (this skill covers injection).
- `.opencode/docs/mocking.md` — boundary design for testable security code.
